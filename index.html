            <h1>FOOD FOR EVERYONE</h1>
            <p>Our planet suffers everyday as well as its people. Hunger still haunts more than 2-billion people worldwide.<br> Please join us in donating to the needy as well as saving the environment from waste in the same time. <br>
                A drastic increase can be seen in food waste. As per data given by Food and Agriculture Organization,<br> 1/3rd of food produced for human consumption is wasted globally, which accounts for almost 1.3 billion tons per year.<br> On the other hand, also as per WHO 20% of the population face extreme food shortages. <br>Hence there is a need to come up with a solution that can avoid food waste & can help 
                feed the needy.
