            <h2 class="another">Out of 62 million tonnes of waste generated annually in India, only 27% is treated and 73% is dumped. <br> Seriousness about waste is essential as excessive disposal harms ecosystems, depletes resources and contributes to pollution. Responsible waste management is vital for preserving the environment/protecting wildlife and ensuring human health. Individuals must prioritize reducing, reusing and recycling to minimize the ecological footprint and foster a sustainable future.</h2>
