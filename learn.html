                    <h1>STOP WASTING FOOD</h1><br><br>
                    <p>Worldwide everyday around 30% of people go to sleep hungry and yearly around 1 billion tonnes of food is wasted. These seem like 2 very big and different problems but when we analyze it in depth we can understand that they are both each others problems and solutions.<br> When food is managed properly we not only solve these issues but we even take a step forward towards preserving and helping our planet. Waste management is really one of the most important aspects that we need to take care of because the amount of destruction and pollution it creates is very massive. </p><br><br>

                            <p>In our model we have taken a very different approach, instead of persuading people and trying to make them believe that we are truly an organization which tries to solve the issue of hunger and not just a scam as we have seen many greedy crimintals do in the past, our model has been designed for people who wish to properly manage food and waste and want to contribute towards the betterment of overall life of all, they are the ones we wish to reach and thus provide a solution by letting them choose which type of food they want to donate and where they want to donate it.</p>

                            <p>We provide our users with addresses of old age homes, orphanages etc close to their location such that they are able to donate it themselves and have a reassurance that anything they donate actually contributes to making this world a better place.<br> We are a totally non profit organisation with the aim of making this world a better place for everyone one step at a time.</p>
